One of the many perils of being transgender is moving from one online personality to another. My old Google account contains my deadname, so obviously I don't want that to represent me. This post is going to contain all the steps I took to leave my old google account behind.

### Google Fi
Google Fi was pretty easy. I just contacted support and asked them to migrate my account. This involved setting up a new Fi account on my new Google account, then waiting for support to transfer it. However, it's probably a good idea to transfer the account near the end of the pay period as Google will simply transfer your number for you.

### Google Calendar
This was as simple as going to the Import/Export page of Calendar settings. It generates .ical files to import into the new account.

### Gmail
Starting over on a new email with no subscriptions to bother with seems way more appealing to me than trying to forward and deal with mountains of email.

### Google Docs
This one was interesting. I shared every folder I had with my new account, then transferred ownership of the documents to it. On the new account, I then removed the share to my old account.

### Google Keep
Keep was a pain in the ass. I had to individually share each note that I wanted to keep, then make a copy of it on the new account. For my pinned notes I did that, but for the other notes I simply copied and pasted them all into new notes. I didn't bother to preserve the timestamps for these notes as long as they were in some sort of familiar order.

### Google Photos
I selected all the photos I wanted to share and added them to an album. I could only select 1500 photos at a time, beware. I set a name like "Migrate 1" on the album and then shared it to my new account. On the new account I can "Add to library" on all the photos. Then I just removed the shared album. This preserves all metadata on the photos. Yet to be seen if it gets back processed for faces and places and other things.  

### Stuff I haven't migrated yet
- Maps
- Google Play Music
- YouTube

### Stuff I didn't bother to migrate
- Payments and Google Pay: Just set up my cards in my new account
- Android Devices: Just signed in with the new account

I decided that instead of posting this all at once, I'll continue updating it as I migrate more services.
