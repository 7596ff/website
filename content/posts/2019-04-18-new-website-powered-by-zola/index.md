This is my first post on my new website. I wrote it using the [Zola](https://www.getzola.org) framework. It's a really slick static website generator written in Rust.

I must admit though, I had a lot of trouble understanding the workflow, so I turned to [the source code](https://github.com/17cupsofcoffee/seventeencups.net) of [seventeencups.net](https://www.seventeencups.net/) for some help. This website was listed in [EXAMPLES.md](https://github.com/getzola/zola/blob/master/EXAMPLES.md) on the main Zola repo. I hesitate to say I copied the website, but I did take a lot from the flow and design.

This was also the first time I experimented with [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/). I had never written serious Sass or even CSS before this, so I turned to [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) to brush up on my skills. The first section they have on HTML and CSS design was extremely helpful. I was completely ignorant of how CSS Flex worked before yesterday. Even if I am no longer pursuing any sort of career in computer programming, these skills were really important to me to learn.

Speaking of my college career, this seems like a good enough time as any to update my dear readers. I recently switched majors from Computer Science. I'm now pursuing a degree in Political Science (PS), with minors in Philosophy (PHL) and Gender/Women's studies (GWS). All of this sounds like basket weaving but I am really excited to learn as much as I can about how this *great country* works.

I also have some sort of idealistic fantasy about going to graduate school. As a trans woman I would love to help educate the public about how gender works. Once I take my first GWS class, I'll make a more concrete decision about what I want to do with my life.
